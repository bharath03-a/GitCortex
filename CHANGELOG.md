# Changelog

All notable changes to GitCortex are documented here.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Discovery surface:** `gcx query wiki` (markdown symbol page), `search`
  (ranked fuzzy), and `tour` (centrality-ranked or seeded codebase walk),
  exposed as MCP tools (`wiki_symbol`, `search_code`, `start_tour`) and slash
  commands.
- **Two more languages:** Go and Java parsers (now Rust, Python, TS/JS, Go,
  Java) with a documented coverage matrix in the README.
- **Cosmograph visualizer** (`gcx viz`) — GPU graph viewer with search,
  inspector, density modes, branch-diff overlay; Host-header allowlist guards
  against DNS rebinding.
- **`gcx export --format json`** — committable, CI-consumable symbols+edges.
- **`gcx export --claude-md`** — idempotent top-symbol table injected into
  CLAUDE.md for zero-tool-call context.
- `DefinitionText` (signature, body, doc-comment, byte range) captured per node.

### Changed
- **Full index ~100× faster** — CSV `COPY` bulk load, O(E) edge dedup, and a
  call-resolution fan-out cap. Django (520k LOC): 413s → ~4s.
- Symbol resolution is kind-ranked (a type wins over a same-named method/file),
  so `wiki <Type>` resolves correctly on Go/Java.
- Schema version bumped to 6 (auto-wipes + re-indexes on first run).

### Fixed
- MCP server stayed up only for the `initialize` response (missing
  `.waiting()`) — all subsequent tool calls now work.
- Multi-line docstrings collapsed in storage (Kuzu escape round-trip).
- TypeScript visibility now reflects `export`; Python captures all module-level
  bindings (not just ALL_CAPS); Java `find-implementors` resolves generic
  `extends Foo<T>`.

### Distribution
- Published to crates.io (6 crates), npm, and PyPI on tag; pre-built binaries
  for macOS (arm64/x86_64) and Linux (x86_64/aarch64). Windows dropped
  (KuzuDB/MSVC link incompatibility).

> 0.2.x was an internal iteration line; its changes are folded into 0.3.0.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-30

Initial release.

### Features

**Incremental indexing**
- tree-sitter AST parsing for Rust, TypeScript, Python, and Go
- Indexes only changed files on every commit — <500ms on typical diffs
- Branch-namespaced graph: switching branches instantly gives you that branch's graph

**Graph schema**
- Node kinds: File, Folder, Module, Struct, Enum, Trait, TypeAlias, Function, Method, Constant, Macro
- Edge kinds: Contains, Calls, Implements, Uses, Imports
- Cross-file edge resolution for all edge kinds

**Git hooks (drift-proof)**
- `post-commit`, `post-merge`, `post-rewrite`, `post-checkout` installed by `gcx init`
- Hook prints a live graph summary after each commit

**CLI commands**
- `gcx init` — install hooks, run initial index, register MCP server globally
- `gcx hook` — incremental update triggered by git hooks
- `gcx serve` — MCP server on stdio
- `gcx query` — one-shot CLI queries (lookup-symbol, find-callers, list-definitions)
- `gcx viz` — interactive force-directed graph in the browser; DOT export
- `gcx blast-radius` — BFS transitive caller risk report (text / github-comment / json)
- `gcx export` — writes `.gitcortex/context.md` codebase map
- `gcx status` — node and edge counts by kind
- `gcx clean` — wipe graph store for fresh re-index

**MCP server**
- 4 tools: `lookup_symbol`, `find_callers`, `list_definitions`, `branch_diff_graph`
- Registered globally in `~/.claude.json` — works across all Claude Code sessions
- 4 agent skills and 4 slash commands installed into `.claude/`

**CI integration**
- `gcx init --ci` writes `.github/workflows/gcx-blast-radius.yml`
- Posts blast-radius report as a sticky PR comment on every pull request
